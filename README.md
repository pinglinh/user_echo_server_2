#User Echo Server

A simple server which takes and returns user's input until they enter "exit" which ultimately stops the server.

The purpose of this task was to follow **TDD principles** to write the actual code whilst keeping **design** of this server **flexible** and **adaptable to change**.

* Entry point to the app is in the **bin folder**
* **Classes** (lib) and their **tests** (spec) are separated into single files

##Dependencies / Requirements
* Ruby
* Terminal

##Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open terminal, cd into the repository and run:

  ```
  ruby bin/user_echo_server
  ```

2. Follow the insructions on screen.
3. To exit the server, type `exit`.
